<b> Lab | <b> PHYSICAL PHARMACEUTICAL LAB II
<b> Experiment|     <b> 8. Bulk Density and Tapped Density determination of Pharmaceutical Powders

### About the Lab (objective):

The Physical Pharmaceutics Lab provides knowledge to determine viscosity, particle size and distribution, sedimentation behavior, stability, and powder flow characteristics. Study about Instruments such as Ostwald’s and Brookfield’s viscometers, sieve shaker, microscope, Andreasen pipette, bulk and tapped density apparatus, and angle of repose will be done. It is designed to enable students to understand the influence of physical parameters on formulation performance, stability, and processability, thereby linking theoretical concepts with practical applications in pharmaceutical technology.

### About the Experiment 

This experiment involves determining the bulk density and tapped density of pharmaceutical powders. It helps assess the packing and flow characteristics of powders by measuring the volume reduction upon tapping. The analysis is essential for evaluating powder compressibility, flowability, and formulation properties, which play a crucial role in tablet and capsule manufacturing processes.

### Target Audience:

Pharmacy students, faculty members & industry persons

### Course Alignment:

This lab is aligned with core and applied courses such as Physical Pharmaceutics, Dispersion Systems, and Rheology. It reinforces theoretical concepts related to viscosity, particle size analysis, and micromeritics, supporting students’ understanding of formulation behavior, stability, and performance of pharmaceutical dosage forms. The experiments strengthen practical skills essential for designing, evaluating, and optimizing pharmaceutical products and processes.
