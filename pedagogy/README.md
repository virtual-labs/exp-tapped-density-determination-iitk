#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy :<u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u><b>Description: 
<br>
The student will be able to identify the apparatus and can set several variables like the selection of powder sample, its sample size, selection of measuring cylinders on the basis of selected sample size and can control the number of taps. By setting these variables on their own student get the concepts and the purpose of each component. Based on the readings they will get the value of Bulk and tapped volume which can be further putted in the formulas to calculate the values of bulk and tapped density respectively.
