<!-- <b>Objectives</b><br>
● To measure the bulk density of pharmaceutical powders in their natural settled state.<br>
● To determine the tapped density after mechanical tapping.<br>
● To calculate the Hausner ratio and Carr’s index for powder flow assessment.<br>
● To understand the relationship between powder density and flowability.<br>
● To compare density values across different pharmaceutical materials.<br>
● To validate results using standardized testing procedures.<br>

<b>Theory</b><br>-->
Bulk and tapped densities are important physical parameters that influence the flow, compressibility, and packaging properties of pharmaceutical powders. Bulk Density is defined as the mass of powder divided by the bulk volume it occupies, including interparticle voids, without external compaction. Tapped Density is the mass of powder divided by the volume after being subjected to a standardized tapping process, which reduces interparticle voids.<br>

The relationship between these densities provides a measure of powder flowability, as shown in the following formulas:<br>
Hausner Ratio (HR) = Tapped Density / Bulk Density<br>
Carr’s Index (CI) = [(Tapped Density - Bulk Density) / Tapped Density] × 100<br>

Lower Hausner ratio and Carr’s index values indicate better flow properties. These parameters are widely used in pharmaceutical quality control and process design.
