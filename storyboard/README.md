## Storyboard (Round 2)



Experiment 1: Bulk and Tapped Density Determination of Pharmaceutical Powders.

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based on the determining the values of bulk and tapped density of some pharmaceutical powder samples by using Bulk density apparatus. Student proceeds with the simulator to understands the concept of density by experimentation. The values of the bulk volume and the tapped volumes are recorded by using several variables like Sample name, Sample size, Size of measuring cylinder and number of taps. The tapping of powder can be done by power on tab on the simulator for a fixed number of taps. The final objective is to find out the values of Bulk density and Tapped density of different powder samples. By performing this experiment the student will be able to understands the concept of density and to apply these concepts during several pharmaceutical formulation development processings.


### 2. Story:
Density is universally defined as mass per unit volume but it becomes difficult when experimentation is done with the powders which particles with microscopic cracks, internal pores and capillary spaces. So, on the basis of the determination of densities, different types of densities are: Bulk density, Tapped density, Granular density and True density. Bulk density is defined as the 'Mass' of the powder divided by the 'Bulk Volume' whereas Tapped density is defined as the 'Mass' of the powder divided by The 'Tapped Volume'. The  pharmaceutical powders which have low bulk density and larger bulk volume are known to be as 'light' powders and the 'heavy' powders are those having high bulk density but smaller bulk volume. The experimental determination of  Bulk ana Tapped density is dependant on the particle size distribution, particle shape and the tendency of the particle to adhere to each other. The particle may pack in such a way that as to leave large gaps between their surfaces, resulting in a light powder or powder of low bulk density. On the other hand, the samller particles may shift between the larger ones to form a heavy powder or powder with high bulk denensity.By studying the bulk and tapped densities of powders it can be utilized to check the uniformity of bulk chemicals, and to determine proper size of containers, mixing apparatus, and capsules for a given mass of powder. <Br> The simulator setup consists of a "Bulk density apparatus" with specifications like power on and off tab for apparatus, Flexibility of slecting a powder sample, Selection of Sample size, Selection of size of measuring cylinder, Selection of Number of taps, recording of the tapped volume at fixed number of tap.
<Br> The powder sample is selected along with the selection of sample size and the size of measuring cylinder. Then click on the "Switch On" button to add the measuring cylinder along with powder sample to the apparatus. Initial volume of the sample is recorded as Bulk volume. Now, the number of taps are selected as 10 and the taps are started with 'Start' option provided on simulator. The respective volume of the sample is recoreded and the same process is again repeated with 500 and 1250 taps and their volumes are recorded respectively.

A. Pitfall Stage 1: The selection of the sample size and the size of measuring cylinder must be synchronised with each other if not then it leads to the error.<Br>
B. Pitfall Stage 2: The selection of the number of taps must be in ascending order only i.e. 10, 500 and 1250 otherwise it leads to error.
